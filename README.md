# QMVision – Mesh Visualization & Debugging Tool

QMVision is a lightweight **OpenGL 4.6** and **wxWidgets**-based viewer for visualizing and debugging triangle meshes generated by [QuadMind](https://github.com/RCL-Consulting/QuadMind) and other preprocessing tools.  

It serves as a **front-end GUI** for inspecting meshes, exploring algorithm behavior, and testing AI-driven meshing ideas.

## ✨ Features
- 🔲 **Mesh rendering** using modern OpenGL (core profile 4.6)  
- 🎨 Separate **color control** for faces and edges  
- 🖱️ Interactive camera controls  
  - Orbit (left-drag)  
  - Pan (middle-drag)  
  - Zoom with mouse wheel (keeps cursor-point under zoom)  
- 🧾 **Mesh picking** via ID buffer for triangle selection  
- 🔤 **Text rendering** (node IDs, debug labels) with stb_easy_font  
- 🪶 Lightweight: no external engine, only wxWidgets + GLAD

## 🔧 Build Instructions
Requires:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) ≥ 3.23  
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for dependencies (wxWidgets, glad)  
- Visual Studio 2022 (or any modern C++20 compiler with OpenGL support)  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RCL-Consulting/QMVision.git
